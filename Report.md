# Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration
- **Port Specification**: Invalid string format for ports ("eighty:80" instead of numeric "80:80")
- **Volume Mapping**: Incorrect nginx.conf path with typo ("nginx.confi")
- **Network Configuration**: Invalid bridge driver specification ("bridg")
- **Missing Dependencies**: No service dependency declaration between nginx and python-app
- **Container Capabilities**: Required network capabilities were not specified

### 2. Nginx Configuration
- **Base Image**: Invalid tag specification ("latests")
- **File Paths**: Multiple typos in file paths ("nginix.conf", "htmll")
- **Daemon Configuration**: Incorrect daemon syntax ("daemon of" vs "daemon off")
- **Default Configuration**: Potential conflicts with default nginx configuration
- **Missing Logging**: No explicit logging configuration

### 3. Python Application Setup
- **Working Directory**: Invalid path specification ("/appp")
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Incorrect package name ("netiface" vs "netifaces")
  - Missing essential system packages for networking functionality
- **Port Configuration**: I have used 8001 port for all the web services.
- **Process Management**: No production-grade WSGI server implementation

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Docker Compose Improvements
- Standardized port mappings using numeric values (80:80)
- Corrected volume mapping paths
- Implemented proper bridge network configuration
- Added `depends_on` directive for service orchestration
- Added necessary container capabilities (NET_ADMIN, NET_RAW)

### 2. Nginx Enhancements
- Updated to stable nginx:latest image
- Removed default nginx configuration to prevent conflicts
- Implemented proper upstream configuration for python application
- Added explicit access and error logging
- Corrected daemon configuration syntax
- Fixed all file path typos

### 3. Python Application Optimizations
- Switched to python:3.9-slim base image for reduced size
- Installed required system packages:
  - build-essential
  - python3-dev
  - net-tools
  - iproute2
- Implemented robust MAC address detection with fallback options
- Added Gunicorn as WSGI server
- Standardized port to 8001 across all services
- Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
- Improved working directory structure and file organization

The application now successfully runs with proper networking capabilities, improved reliability, and production-ready configuration.
